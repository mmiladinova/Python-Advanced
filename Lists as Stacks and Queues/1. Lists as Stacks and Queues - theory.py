Stacks (list as stack) - linear data structure
Last IN, First OUT - LIFO
empty stack => stack = []

* push, insert, add
append()

* delete, pop
pop()


Queues
First IN, First OUT => FIFO
collections.deque
* to check that the queue is not empty *

queue = deque()

* add
append()

*remove
popleft()

# Combinations:
# append() + popleft()
# appendleft() + pop()
